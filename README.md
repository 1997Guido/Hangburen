# Hangburen

## About

Hangburen is a project developed by Dutch students in collaboration with German exchange students.

Our aim is to offer a fun and interactive way for users to learn Dutch and German. This is achieved through a game styled after the classic hangman. In Hangburen, players are presented with a word in either Dutch or German and must guess its equivalent in the other language.

The name "Hangburen" is a blend of "hang" from Hangman, and "buren", the Dutch word for neighbours.

## Features
